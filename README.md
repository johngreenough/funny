## 💩 Design Philosophy

Our design philosophy is simple:
- If it looks good, we change it
- If it's readable, we make it unreadable  
- If it's functional, we break it
- We believe in the power of terrible design to make people laugh (or cry)

## 🎨 Color Schemes

The website cycles through multiple terrible themes:
1. **The Worst Website Ever** - Classic rainbow chaos
2. **The Circus Website** - Pink and green madness
3. **Rainbow Disaster** - Hot pink and turquoise nightmare
4. **The Messiest Site Ever** - Purple and orange confusion
